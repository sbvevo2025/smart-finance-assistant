            "2. **Find free alternatives**: Consider drinking tap water, herbal teas, or infused water instead of buying coffee every day.\n",
            "3. **Make your own coffee at home**: Instead of buying coffee every morning, invest in a decent coffee maker and buy coffee beans or grounds in bulk. This will not only save you money but also allow you to try different brewing methods.\n",
            "4. **Cut back by one cup a day**: If quitting cold turkey isn't an option, start by reducing your daily coffee intake by one cup. This will still help decrease your spending but will make the transition more manageable.\n",
            "5. **Choose affordable options**: Look for discounts, coupons, or promotions at your local coffee shop to get lower-priced drinks. Consider visiting during off-peak hours or on weekdays when prices tend to be lower.\n",
            "6. **Bring a refillable cup**: Instead of buying single-use cups, invest in a reusable coffee mug and ask the barista if they can fill it for you.\n",
            "7. **Consider meal replacement with coffee**: If you're always grabbing coffee throughout the day, try replacing some meals with a more affordable and healthier option, like oatmeal or breakfast bars.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, breaking a habit takes time, so be patient and don't get discouraged if you slip up. Start with small steps, and over time, you'll find that reducing your coffee spending becomes easier.\n",

            "2. **Set a realistic allocation:** Based on your income and expenses, allocate 10-15% of your total budget towards entertainment. For example, if your total budget is $873.30, set aside $87-$130.33 for entertainment.\n",
            "3. **Prioritize free or low-cost activities:** Focus on free or low-cost entertainment options like:\n",

            "5. **Use cash instead of credit cards:** When paying for entertainment, use cash to:\n",

            "\t* Develop a stronger sense of financial responsibility\n",
