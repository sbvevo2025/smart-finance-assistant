# 📊 Smart Finance Assistant – Student Project Template

Welcome to your project repository for the **ISYS2001 Final Programming Project**. This repo provides a starting point for building your **Smart Finance Assistant**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
In this project, you will design and implement a **Smart Finance Assistant** using:
- Python (Google Colab)
- [hands-on-ai](https://pypi.org/project/hands-on-ai/) (chat, RAG, agent tools)
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) (to create a simple app interface)

Your Assistant should include:
- **Chat**: a finance-oriented personality bot
- **RAG**: retrieval from CSV or other documents
- **Agent Tool**: one custom tool (e.g., budget calculator, currency converter)
- **Gradio UI**: a simple interface tying everything together
- **Tests**: a Testing Section in your notebook

## 📂 Suggested Repo Layout
You may adapt this structure or create your own. Clarity and organisation are graded in the rubric.

```
/README.md            ← this file
/assignment.pdf       ← official assignment specification
/starter_notebook.ipynb  ← scaffold notebook with six-step method
/example_diary.md     ← sample Developer’s Diary entries
/data/                ← your CSVs or sample datasets
/tests/               ← your test scripts or asserts
/ai-conversations/    ← weekly AI Evidence Packages (screenshots, notes)
/docs/                ← pseudocode, design notes, planning docs
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Open the `starter_notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Follow the **six-step methodology**:
   1. Understand the problem
   2. Identify inputs and outputs
   3. Work the problem by hand
   4. Write pseudocode
   5. Convert to Python
   6. Test with a variety of data
3. Add at least one **meaningful GitHub commit per week** (Weeks 8–12).
4. Document AI use in your **Developer’s Diary** (`/ai-conversations/` folder or a markdown file).

---

## ✅ Submission Requirements
- Colab Notebook with full project implementation
- GitHub repository with:
  - Notebook, README, and Developer’s Diary
  - Weekly AI Evidence Packages (Weeks 8–12)
  - Meaningful commit history
- Developer’s Diary entries that include:
  - **Artifact**: screenshot or snippet of AI use
  - **Context**: your goal
  - **Reflection**: what worked, what didn’t, what you learned

---

## 📊 Assessment Criteria (Summary)
- **Functionality** – chatbot, RAG, tool, and UI integrated (30%)
- **Testing & Debugging** – clear tests, meaningful edge cases (20%)
- **AI Collaboration & Progress** – AI evidence + weekly commits (20%)
- **Business Relevance** – meaningful finance problem (15%)
- **Clarity & Reflection** – repo organisation, README, diary (15%)

For the full rubric, see `assignment.pdf`.

## 💡 Tips
- Keep your commits small and descriptive.
- Use AI as a coding partner, not a crutch.
- Remember: **undocumented AI use = misconduct**.

Good luck, and have fun building your Finance Assistant! 🎉
